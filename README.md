# Quarantine-Grind
I am excessively bored. so much that i took to solving DSA questions in this break. not much but 3-5 problems daily

## Problems...


# DAY 1 
1. Find the only non repeating character in an array in linear time and constant space.( XOR operation)
2. Find all duplicates in an array where 1<= a\[i] <= n , n=size of array.
3. Maximum sum subarray.

# DAY 2
4. Longest subarray by sum (sliding window approach).
5. First Non repeating character in a string.
6. Product of Array except itself 
7. Happy number (hash set / flloyd's slow and fast pointer approach)
